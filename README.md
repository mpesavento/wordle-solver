# Wordle Solver

A dude wrote a word puzzle for his long distance partner, and now we 
have [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), the addictive 5 
letter guessing game.

But what about those of us that can't remember all of the 5 letter words? 
The guy that is pretty horrible at Scrabble? (definitely not me, nope, not at all).

Given a set of dictionaries, find all of the 5 letter words and given exact positions
or correct letters but wrong position, find all possible words.
Bonus, rank them by commonness.
